          Project 1 was the start to my explorations as a graphic designer. By not using any Design softwares, and using other programs such as Powerpoint, google docs and MS Word, I was able to creatively generate a FInal Poster with the use of those programs.

          I took the first week to jot down ideas and understand which route I wanted to take this project in. The first week was not really a success for me because I felt like the ideas were too forced and it was not something that came out naturally. On top of that, I was not feeling a connection to those ideas since I thought it was more for the outcome rather than the connection I felt during covid. So I scrapped out all those ideas and restarted. It was a good decision that I made since what I did next really helped me shape this project.

         I scrolled through my gallery, and tried finding moments where I saw a pattern, and around December 2020, I noticed a bunch of screenshots and screenrecordings of this one game called Among Us. This is where I started looking into it and realized that there was a phase in majority of the teens lives where we were obsessed with this game and it was such an addictive game that we would go hours without end playing it. I therefore decided to use it as my main idea, and how Among us created this feeling of suction and loopness, where we lost track of time and all that kept us going was this game, and the people we were playing it with.

        I really enjoyed using the concept of generative art, and breaking up an orignal image/idea and creating something new and deep. I therefore used methods such as duplicating and stacking in order to achieve this look. Each week's iteration was a way to improve my concept without losing your initial ideas. My goal was to make it less literal and more chaotic. The final form introduces just traces of Among Us without hitting us over the head about it. Instead, the viewer is left trying to read a complex visual form that suggests getting sucked into a virtual space.
