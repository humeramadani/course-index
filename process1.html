     <p>
      Our first project, Confounding Tools, came with many various opportunities to experiment and relive some of our key moments during the pandemic. Throughout the pandemic, I went through different phases where I had an obsession with various different aspects such as cryptocurrencies, video games, creating an aesthetic, and a lot more. Thus, this project really helps me dive in and ponder on what I spent the most time on and what really made me connect covid times to my life, and link that to design. The following is my process from day one up until the end of the assignment, where you can see a clear progress and change in ideas from one to another until I finally figured out what my ideal projectâ€™s topic is going to be, which was a video game, Among Us.

          <h3> BRAINSTORMING </h3>
          <br>

          <p>

          The first thing we did was brainstorm. The entire class decided to hop on miro, where we collectively came up with different ideas on how we spent our days during covid. We also tried brainstorming on ways that helped 'track' our life in a way, by search histories, frequently used websites, alarms, and a lot more. 
          This brainstorming process was the first thing that helped start my train of thoughts, and made me start thinking of ideas and ways in which I lived through my covid years.

         
<br>
<br>
         My inital inputs were Presto, Tiktok, and Among us, since these were apps that made me think of covid. Presto App since it was something I stopped using on a daily and I lost track of it to the point where my balance went on the negatives and I forgot how going out was once a frequent thing I did. I also thought of Tiktok since it is a platform that boomed during the pandemic. It is the one platform that really helped unite everyone in terms of ideas and trends and is something that majority of the Gen Z feels connected to. I also thought of the Among us Game since it is yet anpther app that helped connect everyone during this tough time. It not only made communicating with friends and family easier, but also included fun challenges where once you started playing, it really sucked you into the game since it was really addictive. 
<br>
<br>

         Thus these initial brainstorming ideas is really what made me start going deep into my quarantine routine and finding bits and pieces of what I did and how I could connect and relate it to design.

          <h3> WEEK 1 </h3>
          <br>

          <p>

          After brainstorming, I finally decided to come up with a few examples, which included screenshots of Presto, Newton (a cryptocurrency platform), and even titkok linked with my aesthetics. 

         
<br>
<br>
         But even after the first week, I did not feel content enough with the ideas I had going on. Thus I decided to scrap out all the ideas and start fresh.  
<br>
<br>

         I wanted to use ideas of getting sucked in and a feeling of living in a loop, while also having a deeper and complex visual outcome.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3> WEEK 2 </h3>
            <br>

          I proceeded by taking screenshots of a bunch of parts from a screenrecording I took earlier, and placed them all around a doc. Using multiplications and duplications, I successfully figured a way to quickly create a swirl effect. I feel like it was not as sharp as I would want it to be, but for a start, it was getting somewhere.

         
<br>
<br>
         Most of the comments I got during critiques were to not have way too many items because sometimes, less is more. I took that into account and made sure to make those changes for next week.
<br>
<br>

         I also had a bunch of additional elements which really hinted at among us, such as the among us characters, the sound waves, typography extracted from the game, and a lot more. But after our second critique, I decided to pull those out and simplify it, which in a way helped abstract my poster.

          <h3> WEEK 3 </h3>
          <br>

          <p>

         For our last critique, I made sure to follow all the notes I took down from the previous week and make those changes. 

         
<br>
<br>
         Thus, it is very evident how I removed many elements and the poster is just left with an abstract 'path' of the Among Us game, that has a sort of whirlpool pattern that makes the viewer feel like they are getting sucked in and swollowed into the game.
<br>
<br>

        Before submitting my final piece, I got a few more critiques, where I was told that it will be a great idea if I am able to just zoom in to the whirlpool and make it seem more chaotic, rather than having a lot going on in the center of the composition and leaving the rest bland. So that is exactly what I did, and then came up with my <a href="final.html"> FINAL POSTER </a> which I am really happy with!!
