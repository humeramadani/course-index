          Throughout this project, there have been tons of up's and down's based on my knowledge in relation to coding. The first 3 classes were quiet challenging not only in terms of coming up with ideas but also analyzing and understanding ways on how to code. 
<br>
<br>
          I took the first week and a half to learn more about how to code and ways to enhance the looks with P5. Starting off with expreimenting with shapes and and just making abstract images, I did not only learn about ways to draw, but also use different tools such as ellipse, circles etc and also play around with 3D shapes.
          <br>
          <br>
          I then started to focus more on my letter 'G'. I did a few overlays and also used many many tutorials from around the web to learn different techniques using p5.
          <br>
          <br>
          There is a very clear progression not only in terms of intricate details but also looking at the complexity in my work. This project started off as a really big jump into the coding world without me having much knowledge thus making it very hard to comprehend and move forward. But over the course of 3 weeks I really developed a strong sense in not only coding but also understanding different parametrics that can be used to create generative artworks.
