          1- After reading through both the articles, it is evident that both articles are leaning towards the same idea, that there needs to be a change in the world of programming and softwares used to design. The need to be dependant and in a way, forced to use the tools provided restricts users to fully display their abilities and show off their true talents. Open-Source tech is a much needed platform that needs to be accepted by many traditional companies such as apple and adobe, where they tend to have more control on the consumer, by making them purchase first, and design second, and by also having very fixed tools that one can use. "Sharing code meant more people became better programmers, giving them vital skills in a world where computers were quickly taking over everything", a quote from the second article, which I think is a great way to justify the entire concept as a whole. It focuses on the GitHub but also points out how the companies are limiting the potential for future designers and programmers to do their best, and is in a way stopping them from becoming the best versions that they can. 

Standardization is a great idea that allows access for potential designers and programmers to open-source programs, and look at them as designers, and not as a customer.

2- Experimentation which mostly includes drawing is my strength when it comes to my graphic design practice. I tend to experiment a lot with not only virtual tools, but also have a more hands-on/practial side to it, which includes doodles, sketching, freehand drawing etc. It not only helps me collect more ideas, but helps me see my strengths and weakness of that particular project.

  1) Lialina defines Universal User as a person who has the ability to do what they want in their own way and achieve their goals regardless of whether the "application" or device is made for that purpose. It is the way a user finds its way around a given source to get to where they want to be, or create something even if the tools are not designated for that. 

While not all users really understand how a computer or application works, Schwulst's argument is based around that concept, that users should create their own websites instead of using cooperate platforms. This way, a user has complete freedom to make, design and or understand exactly what they want instead of finding their way around the idea. It is defenitely an argument that can be linked to one another, mainly because Lialina mentions, "Opposed to this, users, as imagined by computer scientists, software developers and usability experts are the ones who’s task is to spend as little time as possible with the computer, without wasting a single thought on it." It in a way shows that an individual can find its way into creating what they want without necessarily having to have your own website. 

For example, if an individual does create their own website, yes they will have a larger opportunity to create their exact rules and work with it, but at the same time, there Is no need for that since users are smart enough to understand the uses of a platform and how to utilize it in ways which it was not meant to be used in.

2) I feel like I am definitely a General Purpose User/Universal User I only because I tend to take advantage of applications and platforms in ways that it is not meant to be used. Like a FaceTime application on my laptop would exist to call and contact friends and family, but sometimes I tend to use it as a mirror due to the front webcam feature. Or instead of snapping of snapchat, I tweet a snap, which is something that many have recently started doing too. These applications are like an open book, and it is your choice to interpret it the way you want to.

  An artist who I have always admired is Jon McCormack. His work reminds me of more of an animation, or digitally animated photos together. But upon doing some further research, his work consists of methods that involve "algorithmically 'grown' ideas from computer code using artificial evolution and generative grammars." One piece that stands out is Fifty Sisters, 

<a href="https://digitalartarchive.siggraph.org/artwork/jon-mccormack-fifty-sisters/">  FIFTY SISTERS </a>

which consists of repetitive flowers arranged to form another flower. Fifty Sisters is a large-scale installation of 1m x 1m images of computer synthesized plant-forms. I really looked at is as an artwork that must have been created in illustrator or Photoshop by duplicating the images over and over again and realigning them. But then after researching more, he generated this work by not only looping certain commands, but also added variables to relocate each flower.

<br>

Each flower has been created with graphic elements of oil company logos, which all together combine as "sisters".

  2- To me, surveillance is like a close watch/observation of someone, or something. It could be monitoring of not only where a person/thing is, but also observe other factors that can include behaviours, routine, or even could be done for the purpose of protection. The notion of a “vertical” or aerial perspective lends itself to a culture of surveillance because of the lack of distinction between object and subject. It has taken the views and turned it into a one sided notion which changes a viewers perspective. In a way, surveillance controls what we see, and how we perceive it. Not only does it switch ones perspective, but is also very intrusive due to the lack of privacy one gets. The idea of surveillance being present 24/7 is not only making one lack freedom but also prevents anyone from being comfortable to do anything without the feeling of having eyes around them, and always fearing that someone is watching.
